;; A buffer in Emacs represents text, including its mode, local
;; variables, etc.  A Emacsy buffer is not necessarily text.  It can be
;; extended to hold whatever the host application is interested in.
;; Emacs' concepts of buffer, window, and mode are directly analogous to
;; the model, view, and controller respectively---the MVC pattern.

;;; Code:

;; @defmac with-buffer @dots{}
;; A convenience macro to work with a given buffer.

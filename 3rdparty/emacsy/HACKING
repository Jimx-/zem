#+TITLE: Hacking Emacsy

* Committing

Please write commit logs in the [[info:Standards#Change%20Logs][ChangeLog]] format, you can check the
commit history for examples.

* Documentation/API/Noweb

In 0.3 Noweb was removed; the code was split into pure Guile scheme
source code and separate texinfo documentation.  This setup is now
functional and needs lots of work and cleaning up.

The API-documentation is being snarfed using [[file:scripts/doc-snarf.scm][scripts/doc-snarf.scm]], a
heavily hacked version of the script that comes with Guile.  See the
script for some minimal documentation of how it works and what it does.

Use `make doc-snarf' to update the snarfed documentation.

The miminal, empty comment that doc-snarf uses to generate
API-documentation for a function is ;;., like so

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
    ;;.
    (define (undocumented-api-function) ... )
#+END_EXAMPLE

Using the empty description is a placeholder, we will need some actual
documentation in the comment there.  The original doc-snarf uses
whitespace for that.  That does not work for us; we have Emacs remove
trailing whitespace from our code.

We still have to figure out exactly how to do this as we probably want
the same documentation to be available via the self-documenting Emacsy
help system.  Have doc-snarf (also) parse docstrings?

* Texlive

If you are not building a release or checking that the PDF documentation
still builds, you may want to setup a Guix environment without texlive
(a ~4GB download).  Try something like

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
    guix environment -l guix.scm --with-input=texlive=coreutils
#+END_EXAMPLE

* Example Usage

Emacsy usage is being explored in the [[https://savannah.nongnu.org/projects/nomad][Nomad extensible web browser]] and
in [[https://gitlab.com/janneke/guimax][Guimax]]

    Please send Emacsy bug reports to [[mailto:guile-user@gnu.org][guile-user@gnu.org]].

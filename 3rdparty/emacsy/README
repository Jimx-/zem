#+TITLE: About Emacsy

#+SUBTITLE: an embeddable Emacs-like library using GNU Guile

Emacsy is an embeddable Emacs-like library using [[http://www.gnu.org/software/guile/][GNU Guile Scheme]].  It
was a [[http://www.kickstarter.com/projects/568774734/emacsy-an-embeddable-emacs/?ref=kicktraq][kickstarter project]], and it also was a [[https://google-melange.appspot.com/gsoc/proposal/review/google/gsoc2013/shanecelis/1][Google Summer of Code 2013 project]].

I will be working with Ludovic Courtès from the [[http://www.gnu.org/gnu/thegnuproject.html][GNU Project]].  Keep
abreast of its development by watching this repository or following me
on twitter [@shanecelis](https://twitter.com/shanecelis).

Get it
#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
    git clone https://git.savannah.nongnu.org/git/emacsy.git
#+END_EXAMPLE

build it
#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
    guix environment -l guix.scm
    ./autogen.sh
    ./configure
    make
    ./pre-inst-env hello-emacsy
#+END_EXAMPLE

and

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
    ./pre-inst-env emacsy-webkit-gtk
#+END_EXAMPLE

To build a minimal Emacsy, perhaps packaging it for a new distro:
#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
    ./autogen.sh
    ./configure --with-examples=no
    make
#+END_EXAMPLE

Emacsy is free software, it is distributed under the terms of the GNU
General Public Licence version 3 or later.  See the file [[file:COPYING][COPYING]].
